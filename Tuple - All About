## tuple are orderd,immutable,allows duplicate elements.
import timeit
import sys
myTuple = ("max", 24, "boston")
print(myTuple)
## parenthesis are optional
myTuple2 = "Nasr", 24, "boston"
print(myTuple2)
## if you leave your tuple with only single element, it will be considered as string.
myTuple3 = "Nasr"
print(type(myTuple3))
## to have a tuple with only single element, you should add comma at the end.\
myTuple4 = "Khalil",
print(type(myTuple4))  ## now it shows tuple.

mytubel6 = tuple(["max", 28, "boston"])  ## get a tuple from a list.
print(mytubel6)

## to access a and element in  a tuple.

item = mytubel6[0]  ## if you acceed the range number, it will crash. index starts from 0.you can have negative index.
print(item)
## you can not change an element in the Tupl:
##mytubel6[1] = 45
print(mytubel6)  ##tuple' object does not support item assignment

## loop a tuple by the following:

for i in mytubel6:  ## your variable can have any name, not only i
    print(i)
##############
## YOU CAN CHECK IF AN ITEM IS IN THE TUPLE, BY USING IF IN ::

if "max" in mytubel6:
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")

## you can use len function to count tuple items.

print(len(mytubel6))  ## three item are there.

mytubel7 = ("a", "b", "c", "c")

## to check how many times items are repeated:

print((mytubel7.count("c")))  ## 2 C letters are there.
print((mytubel7.count("a")))
print((mytubel7.count("f")))

## to get the index of a tupel:
print(mytubel7.index("b"))  # return 1

## to change a tuple to list:

mylist = list(mytubel7)  ## use list function and pass the tuble name
print(mylist)

## to have the  tuple back:

mytuble8 = tuple(mylist)  ## Use tuple function and pass the list to it.
print(mytuble8)

## slice the tuple
a = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
b = a[2:7]  ## if you didnt provide first index number, it will start from zero index
print(b)  ## if you didnt provide last index number, it will end to the last index
## you can step by any number as shown below.
b = a[2::2]  ## you acn skip by 2, provide second (:)
print(b)

## how to unpack tuple element:
mytuble9 = "nasr", 47, "port said"
name, age, city = mytuble9  ### tuple elemnt count shall match.
print(name)
print(age)
print(city)
####### Tuple takes small size than list.

## import timeit
